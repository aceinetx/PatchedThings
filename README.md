Some things I patched for no reason(?) (For all patches I use ghidra decompiler, and ALL patches are tested by me)
- [ADB Screenrecord without time limit](screenrecord) (side effects: you cannot record less <= 2 seconds, sometimes it may not record properly and I don't know how to fix it, so it may be broken) (Info: original binary got from android 10 x86)
